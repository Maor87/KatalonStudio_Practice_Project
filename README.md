# Katalon Studio Low-Code Automation QA Testing Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Katalon Studio, a low-code automation testing platform, to perform Quality Assurance (QA) testing on web applications. The project focuses on learning and applying various features and functionalities of Katalon Studio to create, execute, and manage automated test scripts efficiently.

## What I Did

In this project, I:

* **Explored the Katalon Studio Platform:** Familiarized myself with the Integrated Development Environment (IDE), its different sections, and the overall workflow for creating and managing automation projects.
* **Implemented Automation Testing with Katalon Studio:** Developed automated test scripts for various functionalities of the target web applications using Katalon Studio's intuitive interface and features.
* **Handled Different Test Scenarios:** Designed and implemented test cases to cover a range of scenarios, including positive and negative tests, boundary value analysis, and user workflow simulations.
* **Implemented Data-Driven Testing:** Learned how to parameterize test scripts using external data sources (e.g., CSV, Excel) to execute the same test logic with different sets of data, improving test coverage and reducing redundancy.
* **Executed Tests via Command Line:** Explored the command-line execution capabilities of Katalon Studio, enabling the integration of automated tests into Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
* **Integrated with Version Control System (Git):** Successfully integrated the Katalon Studio project with Git for version control, allowing for collaboration, tracking changes, and managing different versions of the automation scripts.
* **Practiced on Real-World Applications:** Applied my learning by creating and executing test scripts on practice websites for QA testing, including HealthCare practice websites and OrangeHRM.
* **Performed Regression Testing:** Learned how to select and execute existing test cases to ensure that new code changes or bug fixes did not introduce new defects or negatively impact existing functionalities.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I learned:

* **Katalon Studio Platform:** Gained a comprehensive understanding of the Katalon Studio environment, its features, and how to navigate and utilize its various components effectively.
* **Automation Testing with Katalon Studio:** Developed practical skills in creating, executing, and maintaining automated test scripts using Katalon Studio's low-code approach.
* **How to Handle Different Test Scenarios with Katalon Studio:** Acquired the ability to design and implement test cases that address diverse testing requirements and complexities.
* **Data Driven Testing:** Understood the principles and implementation of data-driven testing in Katalon Studio, enabling efficient testing with multiple datasets.
* **Command Line executions:** Learned how to execute Katalon Studio test suites and test cases from the command line, facilitating integration with automation pipelines.
* **Integration with Version Control System (Git):** Using Git for managing and pushing to remote repo to Github of the Katalon Studio automation project.
* **Regression Testing:** Understood the importance and implementation of regression testing in ensuring software stability after changes.

## Tools Used

* **Katalon Studio:** The primary low-code automation testing platform used for creating, executing, and managing test scripts.
* **Katalon Recorder Extension:** A browser extension used for recording user interactions and generating basic test scripts.
* **Web Browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox):** Used for accessing and interacting with the web applications under test.
* **Git:** A distributed version control system used for managing changes to the project codebase.

## Katalon Studio Features/Skills Used

* **Test Cases:** Created individual test scenarios to verify specific functionalities of the web applications.
* **Test Suite:** Organized and grouped related test cases for efficient execution and reporting.
* **Logs & Reports:** Analyzed execution logs and generated reports to understand test results and identify potential issues.
* **Katalon Recorder Extension:** Utilized the browser extension to quickly record user actions and generate initial test scripts.
* **Record & Spy on existing browser:** Used Katalon Studio's built-in recording and spying tools to identify and interact with web elements.
* **Web Object:** Learned to identify and manage web elements (e.g., buttons, text fields, links) using various locators (e.g., XPath, CSS).
* **Variables:** Implemented the use of variables to make test scripts more flexible and maintainable by parameterizing values.
* **Headless Browsers:** Explored the capability of executing tests on headless browsers for faster and more efficient execution in certain environments.
* **Reuse Test Case:** Implemented modular test design by reusing existing test cases as steps in other test cases, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.
* **Data Driven Testing:** Configured and utilized data-driven testing by connecting test cases to external data sources.
* **Groovy Code:** Extended the capabilities of Katalon Studio by writing and integrating custom Groovy code for more complex logic and operations.
* **Command Line:** Executed test suites and test cases from the command line using Katalon Studio's command-line interface.
* **GIT Version Control:** Integrated the project with Git for version control, collaboration, and managing project history.
* **Regression Testing:** Selected and executed existing test suites to ensure the stability of the applications after changes and bug fixes.

## Practice Websites

* **HealthCare practice websites:** Used various publicly available healthcare practice websites to test different functionalities relevant to the domain.
* **OrangeHRM:** Utilized the open-source OrangeHRM platform to practice testing common HR management system features.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable hands-on experience in utilizing Katalon Studio for low-code automation testing. I gained practical skills in creating, executing, and managing automated tests, implementing data-driven and regression testing, and integrating with version control. The knowledge and skills acquired through this project will be beneficial for future automation testing endeavors.
